# NFT Lottery Contract

## Project Description

The NFT Lottery Contract is a decentralized lottery system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. Participants can enter lottery rounds by paying an entry fee in STX, and winners are randomly selected to receive unique NFTs. This creates an engaging gamification mechanism that combines the excitement of lottery systems with the collectible value of Non-Fungible Tokens.

The contract implements a fair and transparent lottery mechanism where:
- Users pay an entry fee to participate in lottery rounds
- Winners are selected using pseudo-random number generation based on blockchain data
- Each winner receives a unique NFT as their prize
- The lottery operates in rounds, allowing for multiple draws over time

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize traditional lottery systems by leveraging blockchain technology to create:

- **Transparency**: All lottery operations are recorded on-chain and publicly verifiable
- **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the lottery outcomes
- **Digital Collectibles**: Winners receive valuable NFTs instead of traditional monetary prizes
- **Community Engagement**: Building a vibrant community of collectors and lottery enthusiasts
- **Fair Gaming**: Cryptographically secure random number generation ensures fair winner selection

We envision this platform becoming a cornerstone for blockchain-based gaming and collectible ecosystems, where users can participate in exciting lottery events while building their digital asset portfolios.

## Future Scope
